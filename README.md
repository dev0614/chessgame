# chessgame
I've made two chess AI games the first one(Chess.py) works but you need to type in the chess piece you wish to move. I wanted to make the second one(scratch.py) a chess game where you could move the chess pieces just by clicking on them but it doesn't work.

When I run the scratch.py it gives me no errors it just doesn't let me click/move the chess pieces.
